# Program Builder - Current Status and Next Steps

## Current Situation
The ProgramBuilder.jsx file is in a broken state due to failed replacements. The file has extensive syntax errors that need to be resolved before we can proceed with the calendar implementation.

## What Was Completed Successfully
✅ Installed react-big-calendar and moment  
✅ Added trainingBlocks to program data structure  
✅ Created calculateWeeks() function  
✅ Added training block management functions (addTrainingBlock, updateTrainingBlock, removeTrainingBlock)  
✅ Updated step counter to "3 steps"  
✅ Added week calculation display in Step 1  
✅ Created comprehensive implementation plan document  

## What Needs to Be Done
The file needs to be restored to a working state and then we can implement:
1. Step 2: Calendar view with training blocks
2. Step 3: Per-block weekly schedule configuration

## Recommendation
Given the broken state of the file, I recommend:

**Option 1: Restore and Rebuild (Recommended)**
- Save the current working Step 1 code
- Rebuild Step 2 and 3 from scratch using the implementation plan
- This ensures clean, working code

**Option 2: Manual Fix**
- Manually fix all syntax errors in the current file
- Then proceed with calendar implementation
- More error-prone

## Next Action
Please advise how you'd like to proceed:
1. Should I attempt to restore the file to a working state?
2. Would you like me to create a completely new ProgramBuilder.jsx from scratch with all 3 steps?
3. Or would you prefer to manually review and fix the current file?
